# About
This a python script (version >= 3.6) where the idea is that it
> Creates an svg from geographic coordinate system data via a supported projection

Currently it does nothing except printing to console:
```
	Currently only a stump:
	creating physical map described in README.md via not completly satisfying map under
	[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Blank_map_of_the_world_%28Robinson_projection%29_%2810E%29.svg]
	because of one month deadline.
```

# Aim
- create high resolution world maps from raw gcs data
- country borders, country state borders, rivers and lakes are identifiable via its official english name
- borders exist only once (meaning countries sharing borders use the same svg path)
- easily importable into blender
